# Code First Girls Group Project
Portfolio Website 

## About The Project

We embarked on this journey by creating a wireframe using Figma, allowing us to visualise our design concepts. 
Throughout the development process, we collaborated and exchanged ideas through platforms like Slack and Jitsi Meet, 
ensuring effective communication and seamless teamwork. 
Furthermore, we utilised GitHub for version control, enabling us to manage our codebase efficiently. 

## Index.html

Our index.html page takes inspiration from the iconic Matrix movie, while the captivating images were sourced from [Undraw.co] (https://undraw.co/), 
using on-the-fly colour image generation to perfectly match our website's style. 
To enhance the visual aesthetics, we turned to [Coolors.co] (https://coolors.co/) for designing an appealing colour palette.

## The Challenge 

One of the standout features and our biggest challenge was the ability to switch between light and dark mode on our website.
In light mode, the website showcases a clean and vibrant design, perfect for a fresh and modern feel. 
It's easy on the eyes and creates a welcoming atmosphere.
But what sets our website apart is the dark mode option. With just a click, the website transforms into a sleek and elegant interface, 
ideal for those who prefer a more sophisticated and immersive browsing experience.
To experience the magic of light and dark mode, simply click on the toggle switch located on the page. It's that easy!
We believe that providing both light and dark mode options allow visitors to tailor their experience to their preferences, 
making the website more accessible and enjoyable for all.
